== Welcome to PlayBook

PlayBook is a web application made on Rails, by which we can annotate and share all our plays in the community of Wawandco. 

This application allows you to: 

* Add Plays 
* Search Plays 
* Modify Plays 
* Remove Plays 

Thanks to this application we can find many things we do not know, that we can be very useful for later, such as installing any program or how to make iced tea! xD
