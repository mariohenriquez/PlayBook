== Welcome to PlayBook

PlayBook is a web application made on Rails, by which we can annotate and share all our plays in the community of Wawandco. 

This application allows you to: 

* Add Plays 
* Browse Highlights 
* Modify Plays 
* Remove Plays 

Thanks to this application we can find many things that we know we can be very useful, since like installing any program to how to make iced tea xD
